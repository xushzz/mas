#Psalm 
8 a]For the director of music. According to gittith. b] A psalm of David.
1 Lord, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth!You have set your glory in the heavens.
2 Through the praise of children and infants you have established a stronghold against your enemies, to silence the foe and the avenger.
3 When I consider your heavens, the work of your fingers,the moon and the stars, which you have set in place,
4 what is mankind that you are mindful of them, human beings that you care for them?[c] 
5 You have made them[d] a little lower than the angels[e] and crowned them[f] with glory and honor.
6 You made them rulers over the works of your hands; you put everything under their[g] feet:
7 all flocks and herds, and the animals of the wild,
8 the birds in the sky, and the fish in the sea, all that swim the paths of the seas. 
9 Lord, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth!

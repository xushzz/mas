42 
72 Psalm 
42 a] b]For the director of music. A maskil c] of the Sons of Korah.
1 As the deer pants for streams of water, so my soul pants for you, my God.
2 My soul thirsts for God, for the living God. When can I go and meet with God?
3 My tears have been my food day and night,while people say to me all day long, ¡°Where is your God?¡±
4 These things I remember as I pour out my soul:how I used to go to the house of God under the protection of the Mighty One[d]with shouts of joy and praise among the festive throng. 
5 Why, my soul, are you downcast? Why so disturbed within me?Put your hope in God, for I will yet praise him, my Savior and my God. 
6 My soul is downcast within me; therefore I will remember youfrom the land of the Jordan, the heights of Hermon¡ªfrom Mount Mizar.
7 Deep calls to deep in the roar of your waterfalls;all your waves and breakers have swept over me. 
8 By day the Lord directs his love, at night his song is with me¡ª a prayer to the God of my life. 
9 I say to God my Rock, ¡°Why have you forgotten me?Why must I go about mourning, oppressed by the enemy?¡±
10 My bones suffer mortal agony as my foes taunt me,saying to me all day long, ¡°Where is your God?¡± 
11 Why, my soul, are you downcast? Why so disturbed within me?Put your hope in God, for I will yet praise him, my Savior and my God.
